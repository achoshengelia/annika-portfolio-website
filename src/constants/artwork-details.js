      'Salt lakes arise mostly in drylands or deserts. As a result of high evaporation, the salt content of the water is constantly increased. If the rate of water evaporation exceeds the rate of precipitation, salt pans are formed. Climate change and human intervention through water diversification cause saline lakes to dry up. The near collapse of salt lakes leave dust storms threatening human health and agricultural fields.',
      "A physical data visualization examines the decline of some of the world's major salt lakes. The increasing consumption of water by humans, especially for irrigation in agriculture, is a major factor in the desertification of lakes. For example, the agricultural water evolution in the watershed of the Aral Sea has reduced the lake area by 74% and volume by 90%.",
      'The Aral Sea (Central Asia), Lake Urmia (Iran), the Great Salt Lake (USA) and Lake Poopó (Argentina) are all examples of lakes, for which water development for agriculture, mining and cities had a negative impact on. With hourglasses, the data of this sedimentation process is physically visualized and tangible. Comparing the percentage loss of the water surface area from 1984 to 2018 through physical data visualization shows that the consumption of water and not only the climate change has significantly reduced their sizes. The stronger the decline of the lakes during the last 34 years, the faster the sand settles in the lower half of the hourglass. The lake’s desertification progressed more rapidly than in other lakes.',

      "Corn Serve is an video installation piece, highlighting the connection between canned goods and their natural source. In a contemporary society, we are often not aware of the production process of food and where it actually comes from. What we see in the supermarket is a carefully selected, processed and staged result, which doesn't reflect the origin of the products in any way.",
      'The videos in the hologram capture the growth of the plants in an isolated environment, far away from genes and machines, to give a long since forgotten look behind the scenes.'

      'In our everyday life we are constantly constructing images of who other people could be, often based on very little information. These caricatures are formed as a result of our subjective experiences as well as our unconscious associations; they therefore become detached from reality.',
      'Mirage is about visualizing our blurred perception and challenging the observer to surrender to the volatility of such an illusion.',
