The result is a public bench that makes the project accessible to all. Just like the logo, designed by Sophie Lazari, the people are facing each other. This encourages interaction and communication between the sitting partners. Near the benches, slogans from the members of the associations served as thought-provoking elements, opening up a second level to stimulate a discussion about mental health. A link to the project website allowed users to share their own personal story and thoughts on this taboo topic online.',

      'In the course of industrialisation and the associated rapid transformation of the environment, human sensors were unable to adapt evolutionarily. Artificial senses could help to point out new and health-threatening environmental toxins. For people who will live in a heavily contaminated world in the future, such sensory enhancements can provide important information about the immediate environment. ',
      '(Im)perceptible targets two different scenarios, the sensitisation of fine particulate matter4 (PM) and TVOC5 (volatile organic compounds) is targeted. The level of particulate matter pollution is translated into a tactile pattern and the exceeding of the safe TVOC level into an olfactory signal. The main aim is to find out whether it helps to avoid the sources and reduce the triggers, and whether it can lead to a change in behaviour.',
      'The final prototypes each consists of a sensor that measures the fine dust (PM) on the one hand and the TVOC content of the air on the other. In the first prototype, these values are communicated by an individually selected warning signal as soon as they exceed the limit value. The user is inevitably exposed to the odour and must actively act to reduce the value back to normal. As fragrances are also TVOCs, this can lead to a further unhealthy increase in TVOC levels if the users do not take action.',
      'In the second scenario, a wearable prototype was created that allows the user to experience the current level of particulate matter through a tactile vibration pattern. The vibration intensity of the three coin-operated vibration motors indicates when there is an increase in PM levels. A portable rechargeable battery makes the wearable ready for long journeys and daily use. A higher resolution and wearing it closer to the body would provide the user with more information and more complex data via the skin.',
      'In addition to refining the tactile signals and the position of the device on the user’s body, the interface in the form of an app would also have to be revised. This is particularly important, as initial wearing of the device orientation values to learn to interpret the signals. In order to increase the willingness to learn, the design of the visual aids is therefore an essential point to reduce the initial barriers to entry.',

      'Salt lakes arise mostly in drylands or deserts. As a result of high evaporation, the salt content of the water is constantly increased. If the rate of water evaporation exceeds the rate of precipitation, salt pans are formed. Climate change and human intervention through water diversification cause saline lakes to dry up. The near collapse of salt lakes leave dust storms threatening human health and agricultural fields.',
      "A physical data visualization examines the decline of some of the world's major salt lakes. The increasing consumption of water by humans, especially for irrigation in agriculture, is a major factor in the desertification of lakes. For example, the agricultural water evolution in the watershed of the Aral Sea has reduced the lake area by 74% and volume by 90%.",
      'The Aral Sea (Central Asia), Lake Urmia (Iran), the Great Salt Lake (USA) and Lake Poopó (Argentina) are all examples of lakes, for which water development for agriculture, mining and cities had a negative impact on. With hourglasses, the data of this sedimentation process is physically visualized and tangible. Comparing the percentage loss of the water surface area from 1984 to 2018 through physical data visualization shows that the consumption of water and not only the climate change has significantly reduced their sizes. The stronger the decline of the lakes during the last 34 years, the faster the sand settles in the lower half of the hourglass. The lake’s desertification progressed more rapidly than in other lakes.',
