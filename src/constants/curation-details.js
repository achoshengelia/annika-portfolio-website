      'The online art exhibition EXTRASOBER by Forum Prävention aims to show the dark side of the probably oldest and most popular drug – under the guiding theme of a sobering outlook, international artists and cultural figures as well as sober individuals present works and testimonials that fight against the drinking culture that is firmly anchored in the mainstream.',
      'The virtual art exhibition is structured by thematic focal points – creative inputs from 12 artists set thematic accents, which are underlined or clarified by accompanying descriptions and interpretations. The artists show that the approaches to this theme are manifold: as much as the selected artworks differ from each other, so do the questions and subjects that the exhibition explores.',
      //  'One section of the exhibition website is dedicated to audio contributions by people who abstain from alcohol. Here you will find reports that reveal personal opinions about today´s drinking culture from a sober point of view and describe personal experiences.',
      'Curated by Annika Terwey and Sophie Lazari, the virtual art exhibition aims to frame text, sound and image into a comprehensive story that brings viewers closer to the interplay between intoxication, addiction, disease, suffering and power. The artistically and thematically wide-ranging project hopes to create an interdisciplinary conversation about the downsides of alcohol and to pave the way for alternative approaches to the culture of intoxication.',
      'Thanks to the support of the Forum Prävention we were able to realize the exhibition EXTRASOBER – a sobering outlook as part of Forum’s 20th anniversary.',

      'TRASHSPOTTING is a multimedia collection curated by Annika Terwey and Sophie Lazari. The collection uses various products and art pieces to draw attention to environmental problems, raise awareness for this global issue and show possible alternatives for a cleaner future. Additionally, it tries to motivate the observer to question their own consumer behavior in a context of sustainability. While some of the works present sustainable products designed to leave little to no waste, other works artistically reuse “useless” materials that take on a new function and shape.',

      'Pollution knows no boundaries. Waste in particular has become an unavoidable problem in our society. The exhibition Trashspotting, which was on view from 20 March to 27 March at Lanserhaus, Eppan, picks up exactly this topic.',

The World Bank's forecast for 2025 predicts that each person in Europe and Central Asia will produce 1.5 kilograms of residual waste per day. By comparison, in the same region today, 1.1 kilograms per person are produced per day. If people's behavior does not change, our future looks bleak. Nevertheless, there are ways of moving society into a future free of plastic and rubbish. Not only prohibitions and punishments lead to tangible results, but also gentle „nudges“, incentivize people to behave differently.",
